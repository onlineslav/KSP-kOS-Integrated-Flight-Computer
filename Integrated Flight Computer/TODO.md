# IFC TODO

## Handoff: AMO Differential Steering (next session)

### Status
- [x] Differential braking path works and respects `diff_brake_strength`.
- [x] Default brake strength baseline restored when not steering (`abrk_default_strength`).
- [x] Nose-gear brake suppression added during differential steer (nose bindings forced to 0 while split braking is active).
- [ ] Differential thrust still not functioning in flight tests.

### Open Work (Diff Thrust)
- [ ] Diagnose why AMO engine banks are not being applied even when engines are present.
- [ ] Verify `_AMO_MAKE_ENGINE_ENTRY()` creates valid limiter bindings for this craft (suffix or module field path).
- [ ] Confirm writes in `_AMO_SET_ENTRY_LIMIT_FRAC()` actually change per-engine limiter values at runtime.
- [ ] If `ModuleEnginesFX` field writing is unreliable, add/try alternate limiter field/module fallbacks for this aircraft.
- [ ] Add temporary debug logging in AMO discovery/apply path.
- [ ] Re-test in KSP: A/D steering should set outside bank limiter to throttle fraction and inside bank to idle.

### Files to revisit
- `Integrated Flight Computer/lib/ifc_amo.ks`
- `Integrated Flight Computer/aircraft/c_1000h_cfg.ks`
- `Integrated Flight Computer/lib/ifc_display.ks`
## Feature: Cruise Speed Mode Popup (`ifc_gui.ks`)
- [ ] Update handle layout comment at top of file
- [ ] Simplify `_GUI_CRUISE_SPD_TEXT()` — numeric only, no "M" prefix
- [ ] Simplify `_GUI_CRUISE_PARSE_SPD_INPUT()` — takes mode string, returns clamped number
- [ ] `_GUI_BUILD_EDIT()`: add `spd_mode_pm` popup at [5], shift nav [5–7]→[6–8], nav-specific [8+]→[9+]
- [ ] `_GUI_REFRESH_EDIT()`: refresh [5] popup index, update nav label index [6]→[7], shift nav-specific indices
- [ ] `_GUI_TICK_EDIT()`: handle [5] popup CHANGED, update nav cycle buttons [5]/[7]→[6]/[8], shift nav-specific indices
- [ ] `_GUI_COMMIT_EDIT_FIELDS()`: read mode from [5] popup, shift nav-specific indices

## Feature: New State Globals (`ifc_state.ks`)
- [x] Add `FLIGHT_PLAN_DRAFT_COPY`, `GUI_INFLIGHT_MODE`, `GUI_INFLIGHT_COMMIT_PENDING` declarations
- [x] Reset all three in `IFC_INIT_STATE()`

## Feature: End-of-Flight Confirmation
- [x] `ifc_gui.ks`: add `_GUI_SHOW_END_CONFIRM()` — blocking kOS GUI dialog, returns TRUE/FALSE
- [x] `ifc_main.ks`: `_RUN_FLIGHT_PLAN()`A — add `draft_copy` param, save to `FLIGHT_PLAN_DRAFT_COPY` after init, track quit flag, return `"DONE"` or `"QUIT"`
- [x] `ifc_main.ks`: `_IFC_INTERACTIVE_STAART()` — wrap in outer loop; on `"DONE"` call confirm dialog, save/restore `DRAFT_PLAN` across `IFC_INIT_STATE()`; on `"QUIT"` exit
- [x] `ifc_main.ks`: update `RUN_IFC()` aAnd `RUN_TAKEOFF_IFC()` to pass `LIST()` as `draft_copy`

## Feature: In-Flight Plan Editing
- [x] `ifc_gui.ks`: add `_GUI_OPEN_INFLIGHT()` — populate `DRAFT_PLAN` from remaining `FLIGHT_PLAN_DRAFT_COPY` legs, rename COMMIT/DISCARD buttons, set `GUI_INFLIGHT_MODE`
- [x] `ifc_gui.ks`: add `_GUI_TICK_INFLIGHT()` — delegate to `_GUI_TICK()`, handle ARM→commit / QUIT→discard
- [x] `ifc_main.ks`: add `_IFC_SKIP_LEG()` function
- [x] `ifc_main.ks`: in main loop — inflight commit splice handler + call `_GUI_TICK_INFLIGHT()` when `GUI_INFLIGHT_MODE`
- [x] `ifc_menu.ks`: add "Edit Plan" and "Skip Leg" items to in-flight menu + dispatch handlers

Organize these (CLAUDE OR CODEX, THESE ARE INSTRUCTIONS FOR YOU):

- Alter the waypoint cruise mode, so instead of it having 3 drop downs for waypoints, have waypoint type dropdown (Nav Aids, Arrival Navigation, etc.)
  - If you select Arrival Navigation, the next dropdown will be airports, and the next dropdown will be IAFs for the available runways. The reason for this is that the list of all waypoints is currently too long for a single popup menu and this reduces the amount of listed items per popup menu

- Current organization of AMO is not quite aligned with my vision. Augmented Manual Operation is a mode that contains toggleable submodules. One submodule of this is Differential Steering Assist. AMO will have other modules in the future, such as terrain following FBW, etc.
